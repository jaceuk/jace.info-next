Being a big dog lover this passion project saw me dealing with all aspects including UX/UI and full stack development.

Users are able to enter their postcode and retrieve a lsit of dogs that are available for rehoming within their area rather than having to individually search through multiple rehoming websites.

The site gets it's data from a REST API built using NodeJS and Express with all data being kept uo to date with overnight automated data imports.

There is also a fully bespoke admin area for manual data entry should the need arise.
